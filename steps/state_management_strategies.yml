          - text: Finally, let's touch on state management strategies using hooks. Managing
              complex state can be a jog through the park or a taxing marathon;
              it all depends on your tools.
          - text: For local state, useState remains your trusty sidekick. When you have
              deeper trees and shared state, consider useContext or even
              useReducer for more control.
          - text: Combine these hooks to create a robust and flexible state management
              system, ensuring your application's state logic is as clean as a
              whistle.

              in any React application, thanks to hooks! Great work on the
